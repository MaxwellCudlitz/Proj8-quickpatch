# What the application does
Lists all of user's availible calendars after they authenticate with google calendar. After selecting one or several of their accounts to list and selecting a date range, the user is shown a list of date-time ranges that they are busy, as well as a list of times that they are free during, between their date range.

Dates are shown in-order, both free and busy.
